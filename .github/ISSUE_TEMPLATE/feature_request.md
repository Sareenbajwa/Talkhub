**Description**
I would like to request the implementation of a built-in chat feature within TaskMaster. This chat feature would allow users to communicate with each other in real-time, facilitating collaboration and fostering a sense of community within the application.

**Benefits**
a.  Improved Collaboration: With the chat feature, users will be able to exchange ideas, discuss projects, and provide instant feedback to one another. This will enhance collaboration among users and promote efficient teamwork.
b. Seamless Communication: By having a built-in chat feature, users can communicate without relying on external messaging applications or email. It streamlines communication within the application, reducing the need to switch between different tools.

**Use Cases:**
a. Project Collaboration: Users can discuss project details, share updates, and coordinate tasks in dedicated project-specific chat rooms.
b. Support and Assistance: Users can seek help, ask questions, and receive assistance from other users or support staff through the chat feature.
c. Community Building: The chat feature can serve as a platform for users to connect, share insights, and build a community around [Software/Product Name].
